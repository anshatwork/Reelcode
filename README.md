# Reelcode  

Welcome to **Reelcode**, a repository where I combine **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with their **real-world applications**.  

The idea is simple:  
- For every DSA question I solve, I also try to **map it to a real-life scenario** and build a small **implementation or demo application** around it.  
- This way, abstract concepts from coding interviews become **practical, relatable, and fun** to understand.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

Each folder contains:  
1. **DSA Solution** → The standard implementation of the problem.  
2. **Real-Life Application** → A practical project or simulation showing where the same concept can be applied.  

📈 Progress

This is a work-in-progress repository. I’ll keep updating it as I solve more DSA problems and build corresponding applications.
